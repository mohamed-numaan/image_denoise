# Comparative Analysis of Wavelet Transform and Fast Fourier Transform for Image Denoising 
  
 This two technique is used for denoising the image, which means the nosiy image (Blurred images) can be resulted as denoised image.And we are using two techniques namely,FFT-Fast fourier transform and wavelet transform.
